# Q-DELOREAN

</div>

## Introduction

Repository of the research study conducted for the *Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence* course 2022-23.

This study introduces Q-DELOREAN, a novel tool that combines a classical QNLP pipeline with a tensor-based classifier for the classification of Functional Requirements (FRs) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) trained and tested on classical hardware. The QNLP pipeline involves preprocessing the requirement text, parsing it into string diagrams using the DisCoCat framework, and parameterizing the diagrams as tensor networks.

The goals are exploring the classification capabilities of the proposed tool, the comparison of DisCoCat with other compositional models, and the comparison of Q-DELOREAN with classical NLP models concerning many aspects.

## Instructions

No installation is required, just open with Google Colab the notebooks in the `/notebooks` folder and everything will be ready to run in a reproducible environment.
